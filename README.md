## Modification

- Modify or/and add your own links in `lib\CONSTANTS.dart`
- Icon is from [Font Awesome package](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
- Font is from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Replace profile picture with your own picture. There are two type you can use, NetworkImage or AssetImage, you can use AssetImage by replacing `/images/sample.jpg` with your own picture (keep the filename same). Then make some changes with the dart code if necessary.
